# Testing

## Overview

| Type | Framework | Command | Location |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| E2E visual regression | Playwright | `bun run test` | `tests/e2e/` |
| Figma CDP reference | Playwright | `bun run test:figma` | `tests/figma/` |
| Unit tests | bun:test | `bun run test:unit` | `tests/engine/` |

## E2E Visual Regression

Playwright creates shapes on the canvas and compares screenshots against baseline PNGs.

```sh
bun run test              # Run tests, compare against baselines
bun run test:update       # Regenerate baseline screenshots
```

### How It Works

1. Tests load the editor in a headless browser
2. The editor signals readiness via a `data-ready` HTML attribute
3. Tests create shapes via the editor's API
4. Screenshots are taken and compared against baselines using `toMatchSnapshot`
5. Page is reused across test cases for speed (~2s total)

### No-Chrome Test Mode

The editor supports a test mode that hides UI chrome (toolbar, panels) for clean screenshot capture. Activated via URL parameter.

## Figma CDP Reference Tests

A separate Playwright project connects to Figma via Chrome DevTools Protocol to capture reference screenshots for pixel-perfect comparison.

```sh
bun run figma:debug       # Launch Figma with debugging port
bun run test:figma        # Connect to Figma, capture references
```

Requires Figma desktop app running with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`.

## Unit Tests

Engine unit tests use bun:test and target < 50ms execution:

```sh
bun run test:unit
```

Tests cover:
- Scene graph CRUD operations
- Parent-child relationships
- Z-ordering
- Hit testing

### Writing Unit Tests

```typescript
import { describe, expect, it } from 'bun:test'
import { SceneGraph } from '../../src/engine/scene-graph'

describe('SceneGraph', () => {
  it('creates and retrieves a node', () => {
    const sg = new SceneGraph()
    const node = sg.createNode('RECTANGLE', sg.root, { name: 'Test' })
    expect(sg.getNode(node.guid)).toBeDefined()
  })
})
```

## Test Helpers

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tests/helpers/canvas.ts` | Canvas setup and interaction utilities |
| `tests/helpers/figma.ts` | Figma CDP connection helpers |

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| E2E suite total | < 3s |
| Unit test suite total | < 50ms |
| Screenshot comparison | toMatchSnapshot (pixel-level) |
