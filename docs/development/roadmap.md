- Hover highlight with shape-aware outlines
- Tier 1 rendering: gradients, image fills, effects, strokes (cap/join/dash), arcs
- Fill type picker with solid/gradient/image tabs and gradient stop editing
- Canvas background color per page
- Fig-import unit tests, layout unit tests, layers-panel E2E tests

### Phase 4: Components + Variables ✅

Components, instances, overrides, variables, collections, modes, image export.

**Delivered:**
- Component creation from frame/group or multi-selection (⌥⌘K)
- Component sets from multiple components (⇧⌘K) with dashed purple border
- Instance creation from components with child cloning and componentId mapping
- Live component-instance sync with override preservation
- Detach instance back to frame (⌥⌘B)
- Go to main component (cross-page navigation)
- Always-visible purple component/instance labels with diamond icon
- Opaque container hit testing (click selects component, double-click enters)
- Right-click context menu with clipboard, z-order, grouping, component, visibility, lock, move-to-page actions
- Z-order manipulation (] bring to front, [ send to back)
- Toggle visibility (⇧⌘H) and lock (⇧⌘L)
- Move nodes between pages via context menu
- Viewport culling, Paint reuse, RAF render coalescing
- Effects panel UI (drop shadow, inner shadow, layer/background/foreground blur)
- Independent corner radius controls (per-corner toggle in Appearance section)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD for Windows (x64, arm64) and macOS (x64, arm64) builds
- Polygon and Star drawing tools with pointCount and starInnerRadius
- Resizable left/right panels via reka-ui Splitter (persistent layout)
- @/ import alias, shared types module (src/types.ts, src/global.d.ts)
- Codebase lint-clean: 0 oxlint warnings, 0 tsgo type errors
- Variables: COLOR type with collections, modes, bindings, VariablesPanel, FillSection variable picker, .fig import
- Image export: PNG/JPG/WEBP with ExportSection (scale, format, live preview), ⇧⌘E shortcut, context menu
- Splash loader during WASM initialization

**Remaining (deferred to Phase 6):**
- Variant switching
- Variable types: FLOAT, STRING, BOOLEAN editing UI
- Variable-driven theming

### Phase 5: AI Integration & Tooling 🟡

Core extraction, CLI, MCP server, design guidelines, screenshot verification loop.

**Delivered:**
- @open-pencil/core extracted to packages/core/ (zero DOM deps, Bun workspace)
- @open-pencil/cli with headless .fig operations (info, tree, find, export), CanvasKit CPU rasterization, --json output
- npm publishing preparation for core and cli packages

**Planned:**
- Port MCP server from figma-use (117 tools)
- Attached mode: WebSocket to running editor for eval, create, export, screenshot
- Design guidelines system
- AI-driven design workflow via MCP
- Screenshot verification loop

### Phase 6: Polish + Distribution 🔲

Prototyping, comments, desktop distribution, documentation, public launch.

**Planned:**
- Prototyping (frame connections, transitions)
- Comments (pin, threads, resolve)
- Linux Tauri builds (macOS and Windows already covered by CI)
- PWA support
- Documentation site (VitePress)
- Performance optimization (Lighthouse > 90)
- Full Figma compatibility test suite
- Deferred from Phase 4: variant switching, FLOAT/STRING/BOOLEAN variable UI, variable-driven theming
