## Purpose
Vue 3 + Reka UI editor interface. Bottom toolbar, layers panel with tree view and drag reorder, properties panel with sectioned layout (appearance, fill, stroke, typography, layout, position), color picker, and Lucide icons.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Vue 3 + Reka UI component architecture

- **WHEN** user double-clicks a page name
- **THEN** an inline text input appears, blur commits the rename

### Requirement: Section tool
The toolbar SHALL include a Section tool (shortcut <kbd>S</kbd>) in the Frame flyout. Drawing on canvas creates a SECTION node.

- **THEN** a highlight outline appears around the node shape


### Requirement: Component keyboard shortcuts
The editor SHALL support keyboard shortcuts for component operations: ⌥⌘K (create component), ⌥⌘B (detach instance), ⇧⌘K (create component set).

#### Scenario: Create component shortcut
- **WHEN** user selects a frame and presses ⌥⌘K
- **THEN** the frame becomes a component

### Requirement: Z-order keyboard shortcuts

#### Scenario: Toggle visibility shortcut
- **WHEN** user selects a node and presses ⇧⌘H
- **THEN** the node's visibility toggles

### Requirement: Effects section in properties panel
The properties panel SHALL include an Effects section showing all effects on the selected node. Each effect displays as a collapsible row with: color swatch (shadows) or blur icon (blurs), type dropdown (DROP_SHADOW, INNER_SHADOW, LAYER_BLUR, BACKGROUND_BLUR, FOREGROUND_BLUR), visibility toggle, and remove button. Clicking a row expands inline controls.

#### Scenario: Add drop shadow effect

- **THEN** the effect's `visible` property toggles and the canvas re-renders

#### Scenario: Remove effect
- **WHEN** user clicks the − button on an effect row
- **THEN** the effect is removed from the node

### Requirement: Independent corner radius toggle in Appearance section
The Appearance section SHALL show a corner radius toggle button for RECTANGLE, ROUNDED_RECTANGLE, FRAME, COMPONENT, and INSTANCE nodes. When toggled to independent mode, a 2×2 grid of per-corner radius inputs (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) replaces the single radius input. Each corner has a distinct icon. Toggling back to uniform sets all corners to the top-left value.

#### Scenario: Toggle to independent corners
- **WHEN** user clicks the independent corners button
- **THEN** four separate corner radius inputs appear in a grid layout

#### Scenario: Toggle back to uniform

#### Scenario: Panel size persists
- **WHEN** user resizes panels and reloads the page
- **THEN** panel widths are restored to the previous sizes

### Requirement: Throttled WebGL surface recreation during resize
The CanvasKit surface SHALL be recreated at most once per animation frame during panel resize, coalesced via requestAnimationFrame in the ResizeObserver callback.

#### Scenario: Panel resize performance
- **WHEN** user drags a panel resize handle continuously
- **THEN** the WebGL surface is recreated at most once per frame

### Requirement: Variables panel
The editor SHALL include a VariablesPanel toggled from the bottom of the layers sidebar. The panel uses reka-ui Tabs for collections and Editable for variable names/values. Users can create, rename, and delete variables and collections, switch modes, and set variable values per mode.

#### Scenario: Toggle variables panel
- **WHEN** user clicks the variables toggle in the layers sidebar
- **THEN** the VariablesPanel appears showing collections as tabs

#### Scenario: Edit variable value
- **WHEN** user clicks a variable value in the panel
- **THEN** an editable input allows changing the value for the active mode

### Requirement: Fill section variable picker
The fill section SHALL include a variable picker (reka-ui Popover + Combobox) to bind a color variable to a fill. Bound fills display a purple variable name badge with a detach button.

#### Scenario: Bind variable to fill
- **WHEN** user selects a color variable from the fill variable picker
- **THEN** the fill shows a purple badge with the variable name

#### Scenario: Detach variable from fill

#### Scenario: Export via context menu
- **WHEN** user right-clicks a node and selects "Export…"
- **THEN** the export flow starts for the selected node

#### Scenario: Export via keyboard shortcut
- **WHEN** user presses ⇧⌘E with a node selected
- **THEN** the export flow starts

### Requirement: Splash loader
The editor SHALL display a minimalist loading animation (centered logo + progress bar) during WASM (CanvasKit) initialization. The loader fades out when the canvas is ready.

#### Scenario: Initial load
